Exception handling:::::::::


when there is an exception .
The developer does not want disturbance in the program flow.
To achieve this we are using exception handling

oops:::::::::
object oriented programming structure
it is an efficient method used in all programming language like java and python
for multiple resaons we use oops concepts for example reuseability,security,data hiding

class:::
it is a blueprint
example: birds,laptop

object:::
it is a things created based on class
note:one class has multiple objects
example:
1)for a class bird   :objects are parrot,peacock,pigeon
2)for a class laptop :objects are lenovo,dell,hp


#variiable in class and method variiable
class computer():
    a=10                                     #class variable
    b=20
    print("class variable inside class ",a)
    def config(self):                         #config is a method in class 
        c=100                                 # c is a method variable
        print("yes")
        print("instance access",self.b)      # to access an variable of class in method we need to use self. keyword
lenovo=computer()                            #creating an object of class computer,object name lenovo
print(lenovo.a)
print(lenovo.a+lenovo.b)
dell=computer()
print("dell",dell.a)                        # accessing class variable
lenovo.config()                             # accessing config method
