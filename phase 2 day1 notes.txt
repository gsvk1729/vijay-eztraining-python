lambda function :
it is an ananymous function when we want to use function concept without using function name


4 pillar of oops:
1.Abstraction
2.Encapsulation
3.Inheritence
4.Polymorphism

1.Abstraction:::hiding the implementation part and showing only what is required is abstraction
example:exe file
we can make class or method as abstract ,opposite to abstract is concrete


2.Encapsulation::::binding data and function into single entity there exists three types
a)public---- one class info can be accessed by any other class,low level secured
b)private---can used where it is delcared /no in inheritected class,medium level secured
c)protected-- can be accessed only where it got declared ...which ever class inhereited from this class there also we can use.it is highly protected

protected is indicated with _ before variable ex:_a
private is indicated with__  before variable ex:__b
no indication for public variable ex:c


3.Inheritance::
base class and derived class 
derived class will inherit properties of base class

base class- parent class
derived class- child class

types of inheriatance:
1.single
2.multiple 
3.multi level
4.heirarical
5.hybrid
